She was born in the town of Chiaraville, in the province of Ancona, Italy, in 1870. She became the first female physician in Italy upon her graduation from medical school in 1896. In her medical practice, her clinical observations led her to analyze how children learn and how they build themselves from what they find in their immediate environment. In 1906 she accepted the challenge to work with a group of 60 children of working parents in the San Lorenzo district of Rome.
