<img class="  wp-image-282 alignleft" src="https://lfmadata.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/2318281_orig.png" alt="2318281_orig" width="303" height="303" />Jessica Pittman is a true Florida native.  She was born at Jess Parrish hospital and has lived in Brevard County her whole life!  She has been married to Jason Pittman for seven years and they have two awesome kids, Jaylee, 5 and Jaymes, 3.  She loves the beach, camping and traveling.  She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Exceptional Education from the University of Central Florida.  She worked for Brevard Public Schools for five years at Cocoa Beach Jr/Sr. High School.  Over that time, she also took classes to add endorsements in Reading and Middle Grades Integrated Curriculum to her teaching certificate

Shortly after the birth of her first child, she took a leave of absence at BPS which turned into a resignation with the news of baby #2.  She has been a stay at home mom for the past 4 years and has loved every minute of it.  When it was time for Jaylee to attend preschool, she and her husband searched for a school that would provide the kind of creative, character building education they wanted for her.  They were so lucky to find Lake Fern Montessori Academy!  It was everything they could have wanted; supportive yet independence building teachers, an accessible, hands on learning environment and an all-around awesome school community of students, teachers, and parents.

When she was offered the opportunity to be a part of the LFMA team, she could not pass it up!  She was so excited to be back in the classroom and have the opportunity to help your child receive the individualized education they deserve!
