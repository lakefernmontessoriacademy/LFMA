Mrs. Jennifer Ward was born and raised in Titusville. She has a great love for this area and the proximity to the beaches! You can find her and her family of: Scott, her husband; Brittany, her daughter; and Jayson, her son; at the beach or at the dog park with their 3rd “child”, Bailey, a coonhound/boxer mix rescued from the SPCA. Mrs. Ward attended Brevard Community College, University of Central Florida, and the North American Montessori Center.

&nbsp;

She received her Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology from UCF and holds an International Montessori Teaching Diploma from NAMC. Mrs. Ward comes from a large, close-knit family and attributes her love of children to growing up surrounded by cousins of every age. Growing up, she started babysitting at 12 years old for her niece and continued babysitting through high school. She has been in the LFMA community since 2005 where she started out as an assistant in the K-2 classroom. Mrs. Ward loves learning new things and enjoys reading everything from history books to young adult, biographies to science fiction. In her spare time she enjoys reading, spending time with her children and family, going to the beach, and trying to make her puppy Bailey realize she's a dog.
