Lake Fern Montessori Academy is a private preschool, elementary, and middle school serving children ages two and one half through eighth grade. The primary focus of Lake Fern Montessori Academy is to provide a quality, individualized educational environment in which the child can experience developmental excellence.

LFMA is made up of multi-level classrooms, whose scholastics overlap somewhat to allow placement of each student according to ability rather than chronological age. Each environment is designed to challenge the student to his or her fullest potential, by allowing the child to excel beyond "grade level" in her areas of interest while giving the child the materials necessary to progress steadily in other areas. Utilizing the Montessori method of teaching we have developed proven educational programs for young children which sets the foundation for educational experiences throughout life. The true value of the Montessori method comes when the child is able to use the tools and skills learned in earlier years and in turn, share them with others.
